[Dynamic Information Design under Constrained Information Rules](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pQUdeLEAiMkEHaPjuNzBJM_WxiiDdDIg/view) (with [Daniel Monte](https://sites.google.com/site/dma33danielmonte/))

  Revision requested at the _American Economic Journal: Microeconomics_ - November, 2020.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> We study dynamic information design under constrained communication rules, motivated by record keeping regulations and targeted transparency policies. Constrained rules require that messages cannot be conditioned on private information. A long-run and uninformed designer wishes to persuade short-lived agents to invest in a project of fixed, but unknown, quality. The restriction on the possible communication rules hinders the designer without benefiting the agents. It unambiguously decreases welfare if the designer has altruistic motives. The optimal policy qualitatively depends on the conditional payoff distribution and if failures are very informative, constrained rules are less restrictive: simple policies approximate the designer's first-best payoff.</p>

<ins>Persuading Crowds</ins>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> A sequence of short-lived agents must choose which action to take under a fixed, but unknown, state of the world. Prior to the realization of the state, a long-lived principal designs and commits to a dynamic information policy in order to persuade agents towards his most preferred action. The principal’s persuasion power is potentially limited by the existence of conditionally independent and identically distributed private signals for the agents as well as their ability to observe history of past actions. I characterize the problem for the principal in terms of a dynamic belief manipulation mechanism and analyze its implication for social learning. I prove that the optimal policy is the static concavification of principal's payoff in every period (greedy policy) and it has the same value of a policy that discourages all agents from following own signals (single disclosure policy), for a sufficiently patient principal. I also show when the optimal policy and the single disclosure policy coincide, for any given discount factor and for the long-concave class of distribution of private beliefs.</p>
