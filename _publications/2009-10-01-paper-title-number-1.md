excerpt: 'We study dynamic information design under transparent communication rules, motivated by record keeping regulations and targeted transparency policies. Transparent rules require that messages cannot be conditioned on private information. An uninformed long-run designer wishes to persuade short-lived agents to invest in a project of fixed, but unknown, quality. The restriction on the possible communication rules hinders the designer without benefiting the agents. It unambiguously decreases welfare if the designer has altruistic motives. The optimal policy qualitatively depends on the conditional payoff distribution and if failures are very informative, transparent rules are less restrictive: simple policies approximate the designer’s first-best payoff.'
