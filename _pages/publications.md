[Dynamic Information Design under Constrained Information Rules](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pQUdeLEAiMkEHaPjuNzBJM_WxiiDdDIg/view) (with [Daniel Monte](https://sites.google.com/site/dma33danielmonte/))

<p style='text-align: justify;'> We study dynamic information design under constrained communication rules, motivated by record keeping regulations and targeted transparency policies. Constrained rules require that messages cannot be conditioned on private information. A long-run and uninformed designer wishes to persuade short-lived agents to invest in a project of fixed, but unknown, quality. The restriction on the possible communication rules hinders the designer without benefiting the agents. It unambiguously decreases welfare if the designer has altruistic motives. The optimal policy qualitatively depends on the conditional payoff distribution and if failures are very informative, constrained rules are less restrictive: simple policies approximate the designer's first-best payoff.</p>
